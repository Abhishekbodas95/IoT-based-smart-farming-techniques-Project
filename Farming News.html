			   <p id="content">Smart farming for precision agriculture is based on IOT and Monitoring agriculture which is accessible through the main frame Internet Infrastructure using web application. The server response system will be integrated with the strong database support in order to process the response or feedback build and bring to market new innovative IoT applications at 10 times the speed of other approaches with our rapid application development environment and drag and drop mashup builder. It has Leverage big data and analytics to provide new insights and recommendations to aid in better decision-making. It Enable farmers to easily visualize data and take action on insights and recommendations order to process the response or feedback build and bring .</p>

			   <p id="title">Overview Of Precision farming Agriculture</p>
			   <p id="content">. The main purpose of these site is to provide a farmer a new generation device that  can be use in agriculture field over any electronics device using Transmission Control and Internet Protocol through any smart phone or Internet operating device. The technology implemented for this purpose is Internet Of Things. The microprocessor that we use here is Raspberry Pi that will include all different types of sensors in cooperated. This device will operate in farming place  where it can sense data from agriculture like soil quality, Water Level in soil, fertility, Humidity and temperature  that requires crop to grow at specific time period it will analyze data that is received from agricultural area and give farmer a statistical data that will help farmers to solve their crop cultivation.</p>

			   <p id="title">Smart and precision farming motto</p>
			   <p id="content">Despite being a newer concept in the field, there has been a tremendous popularity in the agricultural circuits about the benefits of smart farming and the applicability of IoT. It has been looked upon as a hope to encourage innovation in agriculture with connected farms speculated to be the future of farming considering the Indian perspective . IoT could be utilized to make the best out of our agricultural potential.New innovative IoT applications are addressing these issues and increasing the quality, quantity, sustainability and cost effectiveness of agricultural production. Todays large and local farms can, for example, leverage IoT to remotely monitor sensors that can detect soil moisture, crop growth and livestock feed levels, remotely manage and control their smart connected harvesters and irrigation equipment, and utilize prediction logics and analytics to quickly analyze operational data.</p>

				 <p id="title">IOT based farming</p>
			   <p id="content"> Smart farming for precision agriculture is based on IOT and Monitoring agriculture which is accessible through the main frame Internet Infrastructure using web application.The server response system will be integrated with the strong database support in order to process the response or feedback obtained from  device. This project will reduce the gap between customizable electronics devices  and programming application or softwares since because of these project electronic devices can be programmed, interfaced and Monitored with any other Object Oriented Languages like Java and Web based language  like HTML, PHP etc.
New innovative IoT applications are addressing these issues and increasing the quality, quantity, sustainability and cost effectiveness of agricultural production. Todays large and local farms can, for example, leverage IoT to remotely monitor sensors that can detect soil moisture, crop growth and livestock feed levels, remotely manage and control their smart connected harvesters and irrigation equipment, and utilize prediction logics and analytics to quickly analyze operational data combined with 3rd party information, such as weather services, to provide new insights and improve decision making.</p>
